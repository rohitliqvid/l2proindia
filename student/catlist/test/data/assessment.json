They are a start-up in stealth mode and have now recently developed a proof-of-concept (POC). The POC has basic functionality implemented that can allow them to demonstrate to potential investors. Their development plans include a radical design of pens, custom-designed hardware that improves the accuracy, an app that interfaces with the pen, and much more. The team is also thinking of selling directly to early adopters in India, US, and China through a crowdsourcing platform. Their goal is to sell 10000 pens as a trial launch. Below are some situations where your insights on Intellectual Property can help FuturePen.",
