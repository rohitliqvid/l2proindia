	<p class="marginBottom10">IP is a common buzzword these days for businesses and startups that aspire to grow through innovation in a competitive marketplace. However, it’s not completely understood and often results in startups ignoring this powerful right. So, let’s try to demystify Intellectual Property.
    </p>
	<p class="marginTop10 marginBottom10">Governments around the world have established laws and regulations that allow for protecting and commercializing innovations. They are referred to as Intellectual Property Rights, commonly known as IPRs. The goal is to make sure people have the incentive to invest in new innovations and creations while granting protection against competitors who simply copy the inventions. In other words, IP is the single-most important tool that facilitates markets for ideas. 
 </p>
  <p class="bold marginTop10">The goal for this program is to introduce you to the various forms of IPRs, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights. At the end of the program, you should have a good understanding of how to use them to help protect and grow your business.
